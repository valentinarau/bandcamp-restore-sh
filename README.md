# bandcamp-restore-sh
This is a script I made using [bandcamp-dl](https://github.com/iheanyi/bandcamp-dl) that downloads single tracks or albums.

### Motivation
I had a lot of bandcamp music in my computer, so after a OS reset, i wanted to have my music back, but going 1 by 1 was too much.

### Use
It downloads all albums or tracks from a .txt. You can pass the path as a parameter, or by default it will search for a "bandcamp.txt" in the same directory.  
`bash bc.sh [PATH] `
